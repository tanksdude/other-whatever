# Reversing a Linked List

A small program with a linked list class and a function to reverse said linked list.

## Why?

I saw this problem listed as a challenge, thought it wasn't, and made this to confirm it wasn't.

Note: I only did a little testing on the linked list class. Don't use it for important stuff.

## Building (Linux)

Using the Makefile:

```
cd <this project>
make
```

Then `./llr.out`.
