# Chutes and Ladders

A JavaScript game that runs Chutes and Ladders (Snakes and Ladders) game, complete with an elementary UI.

The board I was given didn't have ladders... but you could easily insert one.

Chutes and Ladders usually involves more than one player, but that wasn't asked of me so I didn't include it.

## Why?

Someone asked me to make this, so I did... unfortunately it received no more than a sentence of feedback and it was never talked about again. But I liked my elementary way of handling UI stuff (it's literally just a region in the canvas), so I'm putting it here.

## Building

Just load `chutes-and-ladders.html` file into a browser. (Make sure `main.js` and `board.png` are in the same directory as the HTML file.)

## Requirements

I don't think it requires ES6 but either way you shouldn't have a browser that's *that* out-of-date.
