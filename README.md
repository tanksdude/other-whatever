# Other Whatever...

A collection of ... stuff. Mostly small programs that I feel are too large to go in my "whatever" repository but aren't important enough to get their own repository.

## Getting Started

Each project does something different. Some may be worthwhile to look at but you've probably seen something similar before.

## Building

Each project needs to be built differently, if it needs to be built. There is no provided function to build every project.

## Contributing

if ya want to, then sure, maybe. But the point of these small-ish projects means there's no need.

## License

Each project is licensed differently.

No idiots clause: No project in this repository has a warranty, regardless of how it is licensed.
